## Notes

This is a baseline commit - all required features are in, but none of the fun optionals.  The biggest challenge for this was really finding time and knowing where to find the right resource.  Most of the coding was done in the airports and in flight, with spotty network connection, and I frequently didn't have the right resource downloaded for the off-line use.  Hoping to do better from next time as I don't have any other international travel scheduled during the course.
